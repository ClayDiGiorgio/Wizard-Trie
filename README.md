# Wizard-Trie
An animation of a wizard magically creating a trie. Created for Dr. Szumlanski's CS1 class at UCF.

Builds an initial trie from corpus.txt without animating. It then reads from animate.txt and animates the insertion of the words found there.

Please don't put punctuation, this program can't handle those yet.
